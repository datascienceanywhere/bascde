**Abstract:**

This project focuses on developing a comprehensive marketing automation system designed to optimize communication strategies for healthcare professionals (HCPs) using advanced artificial intelligence techniques. The system is comprised of four integral modules: Data Pipeline, Decision Model, Optimizer, and Next Best Action (NBA).

The Data Pipeline module is responsible for extracting and integrating data from diverse sources to ensure a robust and comprehensive dataset. This dataset serves as the foundation for the Decision Model, which leverages a deep learning algorithm to predict the prescription (Rx) behavior of HCPs for the current week. Based on these predictions, the model recommends the most effective communication channels, such as calls, emails, remote engagement (RTE), high-quality engagement (HQE), and sample distributions.

The deep learning-based Decision Model is the cornerstone of this system, providing sophisticated predictive capabilities that address complex business use cases. It enables precise targeting and personalized recommendations, significantly enhancing the relevance and impact of marketing communications.

The Optimizer module functions as a policy engine, taking the Decision Model's output and applying business rules to determine the optimal promotional strategy. It ensures that the recommendations align with overarching business objectives and compliance requirements.

Finally, the Next Best Action (NBA) module refines these recommendations by selecting the most appropriate content for each chosen channel, thereby personalizing the communication to enhance engagement and impact.

This integrated approach leverages deep learning and data-driven insights to streamline marketing efforts, improve the relevance of communications, and ultimately enhance the effectiveness of promotional strategies for healthcare professionals. The implementation of this system is expected to significantly boost marketing efficiency and drive better health outcomes through targeted and timely HCP engagement.
