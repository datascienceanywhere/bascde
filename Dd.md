**Abstract:**

This project introduces MATCh 2.0, a state-of-the-art marketing automation system designed to optimize communication strategies for healthcare professionals (HCPs) using advanced artificial intelligence. At the core of MATCh 2.0 is a deep learning model that predicts HCP prescription (Rx) behavior for the upcoming week, recommending the most effective communication channels, such as calls, emails, remote engagement (RTE), high-quality engagement (HQE), and sample distributions.

The deep learning model in MATCh 2.0 represents a significant advancement over existing approaches, such as Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Mixed-Effects Models (MCE). It demonstrates superior performance in both predictive accuracy and business metrics, leading to more precise targeting and personalized recommendations.

By leveraging this deep learning model, MATCh 2.0 effectively streamlines marketing efforts, enhances the relevance of communications, and improves the overall effectiveness of promotional strategies for HCPs. This innovative approach promises substantial improvements in marketing efficiency and better health outcomes through targeted and timely HCP engagement.
